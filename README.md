## Technical assessment - take home 

We are a very practical team at Health Care Informed and this extends to the way that we work with you to find out if this team is a great fit for you. We want you to come away with a great understanding of the work that we actually do day to day and what it is like to work with us. 

So instead of coding at a whiteboard with someone watching over your shoulder under high pressure, which is not a thing we often do, we instead discuss code that you have written previously when we meet face to face.

The Brief:

_“A Health Care Informed customer needs to be able to_ **_find patient visit information_** _at one of their hospitals. Create a simple web application using React, Typescript, C# and a DB that allows a customer to_ **_search_** _patient/hospital visit information and display results. The application should have a very simple styled UX, some simple API’s and a basic data store”._

**Guidelines**

* Don’t spend too long on it (~4 hours) and keep things simple. This is not a time limit just a guideline.
* Don’t worry about:
  * Authentication 
  * Adding tests
* Do focus on:
  *  Solve the customer problem in any way you like
  *  The deliverable is well packaged and easy for us to test
  *  Clearly communicate any assumptions you want to make, shortcuts you take etc.
  *  Spend your time in the right places based on your strengths - e.g. use an in memory DB if it's faster for you, or find an easy way to provide data to the application
  *  Record a [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) (max 5 mins) OR deploy to Azure [free tier services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services) so we can see what it looks like
* What I'm mainly looking for:
  * You structure your front and back end code well so it's clean, modular & well organised. Attention to detail important.
  * How do the well do the components talk to each other on FE, API's and BE structure. These interfaces are important.
  * You understand the customer requirement and make sensible trade offs for feature quality versus **keeping it simple**.
  * How easy is it for us to test and run
* Think of this like an open source project. Create a repo on Github, use git for source control, and use README.md to document what you built for the newcomer to your project, create PR’s etc like you normally would.

**Next:** 

* When you’re done, **send us a link to the Github project and the Azure link / Loom** to vinny.lawlor@hci.care - it will be reviewed by engineering and the CTO within 2 days.

<!---->

* In the next interview stage we will talk to you about your code and do a systems design type question - we’ll talk about your choices, and what decisions/trade offs you’d make as the system scales.
* No coding required in the face to face but we want to see how you think about problem solving when customer constraints change - it’ll be more of a system design discussion.
