## Technical assessment - take home 

We are a very practical team at Health Care Informed and this extends to the way that we work with you to find out if this team is a great fit for you. We want you to come away with a great understanding of the work that we actually do day to day and what it is like to work with us. 

So instead of coding at a whiteboard with someone watching over your shoulder under high pressure, which is not a thing we often do, we instead discuss code that you have written previously when we meet face to face.

The Brief:

_“A Health Care Informed customer needs to be able to_ **_find patient visit information_** _at one of their hospitals. Create a simple web application using React, Typescript, C# and a relational database that allows a customer to_ **_search_** _patient/hospital visit information and display results. The application should have a very simple styled UX, some simple API’s and a basic DB schema”._

**Guidelines**

- Don’t spend too long on it (<=4 hours) and keep things simple
- Think of this like an open source project. Create a repo on Github, use git for source control, and use README.md to document what you built for the newcomer to your project, create PR’s etc like you normally would.
- Don’t worry about doing authentication or anything outside the scope of the search functionality. 
- You only need to write one test for front-end & back-end and add comments/talk about where you’d add more - no need to code more than that, we’re just looking for an idea of how you think about testing
- Please deploy to Azure using whatever services you feel are appropriate so we can use it. Use free tier services they dont need to be always on.


**Next:** 

- When you’re done, send us a link to the Github project and the Azure website: vinny.lawlor\@hci.care - it will be reviewed by engineering and the CTO within 2 days.

- In the next interview stage we will talk to you about your code and do a systems design type question - we’ll talk about your choices, and what decisions/trade offs you’d make as the system scales.
- No coding required in the face to face but we want to see how you think about problem solving when customer constraints change - it’ll be more of a system design discussion.
